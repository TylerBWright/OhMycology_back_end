<h2>OhMycology is a rallying point for mushroom enthusiasts at every level.</h2>

<p>This social network / identification community was developed with React, Java, Spring Hibernate, JavaScript, HTML5, CSS, MySQL, Maven, and Postman as my final capstone project for Claim Academy's Java Full Stack Web Developer bootcamp (Aug. 2021 cohort). Most of the website is fully functional, with the exception of the messenger platform which is a work in progress. It is scheduled for full deployment via ohmycology.net in the Fall of 2021.</p>

Members are prompted to register or log-in in order to participate fully in the OhMycology network. Members have access to the following:

<ol>
<li><strong>Substrate:</strong> A showcase of mushroom finds submitted by OhMycology contributors. Members provide a photo and details on their mushroom, to include morphological attributes, location, etcetera–and then the group chimes in.</li>
<li><strong>Mycorrhizae:</strong> Members may engage in direct virtual chats with peers via the Mycorrhizae messenger platform.</li>
<li><strong>Herbarium:</strong> Each month we provide a highlight of one of the more interesting member finds. In addition to archiving member contributions for posterity, our staff and guest bloggers provide additional information on the genus through a literature review.</li>
<li><strong>Additional Features:</strong> editing profile; administrative moderation (remove comments).</li>
</ol>

<h3>Genesis</h3>

We recognized a need to connect mushroom foragers, professional mycologists, and naturalists together online–and thus began OhMycology. Our aim with this social network and identification community is to solve the following challenges:

<ol>
<li>Tired of always being the only one to show up to a mushroom hunt? OhMycology brings fellow enthusiasts straight to you from the comfort of your own home.</li>
<li>Before deciding to sauté that puffball, you should probably get a second opinion... and a third! An old wise man once said: <em>"There are old mushroom foragers and bold mushroom foragers, but there are no old bold mushroom foragers."</em></li>
<li>Despite there being more resources than ever before to positively ID mushrooms in the wild, people are still afraid of them. We aim to put that fear to rest!</li>
</ol>

<h3>Membership</h3>

Members are comprised of three unique roles:

<ol>
<li><strong>Reishi:</strong> Known for centuries as the king of the mushrooms. This role is reserved for our tireless administrators who manage the Wood Wide Web and keep everything going.</li>
<li><strong>Chanterelle:</strong> Professional mycologists belonging to a variety of scientific backgrounds. If you see a chanterelle weigh-in, chances are they know what they are talking about.</li>
<li><strong>Morel:</strong> These are our regular Joes and Janes in the field, honing their morel compass each and every day.</li>
</ol>

Expect to see OhMycology.net go live this Fall!

Many thanks goes out to all of the staff, instructors, and mentors of Claim Academy who helped me realize this corner of the internet.
